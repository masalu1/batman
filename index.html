                    Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American
                    industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his
                    parents, Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led
                    him to craft the Batman persona and seek justice against
                    criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his
                    personal residence, Wayne Manor. Wayne averts suspicion by
                    acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his
                    family's fortune and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his
                    inherited conglomerate.[74][75] He supports philanthropic causes
                    through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, which in part addresses
                    social issues encouraging crime as well as assisting victims of
                    it, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite.[76] In
                    public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status
                    women, which encourages tabloid gossip while feigning
                    near-drunkenness with consuming large quantities of disguised
                    ginger ale since Wayne is actually a strict teetotaler to
                    maintain his physical and mental prowess.[77] Although Bruce
                    Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities as
                    Batman account for most of his time

                    Various modern stories have portrayed the extravagant, playboy
                    image of Bruce Wayne as a facade.[79] This is in contrast to the
                    Post-Crisis Superman, whose Clark Kent persona is the true
                    identity, while the Superman persona is the facade.[80][81] In
                    Batman Unmasked, a television documentary about the psychology
                    of the character, behavioral scientist Benjamin Karney notes
                    that Batman's personality is driven by Bruce Wayne's inherent
                    humanity; that "Batman, for all its benefits and for all of the
                    time Bruce Wayne devotes to it, is ultimately a tool for Bruce
                    Wayne's efforts to make the world better". Bruce Wayne's
                    principles include the desire to prevent future harm and a vow
                    not to kill. Bruce Wayne believes that our actions define us, we
                    fail for a reason and anything is possible.[82] Writers of
                    Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted
                    the two. Interpretations vary depending on the writer, the
                    story, and the timing. Grant Morrison[83] notes that both heroes
                    "believe in the same kind of things" despite the day/night
                    contrast their heroic roles display. Morrison notes an equally
                    stark contrast in their real identities. Bruce Wayne and Clark
                    Kent belong to different social classes: "Bruce has a butler,
                    Clark has a boss." T. James Musler's book Unleashing the
                    Superhero in Us All explores the extent to which Bruce Wayne's
                    vast personal wealth is important in his life story, and the
                    crucial role it plays in his efforts as Batman.
